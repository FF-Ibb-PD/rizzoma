<div>Dear {{name}},<div><br></div><div>Just found your old post {{post}}.
    It&#39;s really awesome. Why didn&#39;t I see it before? <br>

    Our team loved the Wave. We&#39;ve used it in our business and just for fun conversations.
    There was no way we could go back to email. When Google decided to shut the project down we had only one true
    way â€” to resurrect the great
    idea and continue its development. At the moment, <a href="http://rizzoma.com/">our project</a> is launched
    and works pretty good for more than 3000 active users. We would be happy to tell ex-wavers about it.<br>
</div><div><br></div><div>Prior to Rizzoma&#39;s development, we made a survey about active Wavers community
    and found out what attracted and annoyed the most. That was really helpful from UX point of view.
