Dear {{name|raw}},

Just found your old post {{post|raw}}. It's really awesome. Why didn't I see it
before?

Do you know that Wave idea is still alive?

Our team loved the Wave. We've used it in our business and just for fun
conversations. There was no way we could go back to email. When Google
decided to shut the project down we had only one true way â€” to resurrect the
great idea and continue its development. At the moment, our
project<http://rizzoma.com/>is launched and works pretty good for more
than 3000 active users. We would
be happy to tell ex-wavers about it.

Prior to Rizzoma's development, we made a survey about active Wavers
community and found out what attracted and annoyed the most. That was
really helpful from UX point of view. Here is the full version of
infographics <http://blog.rizzoma.com/2012/01/15/google-wave-necroscopy/>.


What do you think, will the earthlings treasure the idea this time?
